## About
A custom front-end website designed to give the business a professional online presence. 
Includes social share cards for clean link previews and a working contact form — 
built without a backend using Google Apps Script to handle form submissions serverlessly.

## Built With
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Google Apps Script (contact form)
- Canva (design assets)

## Running Locally
No build step or dependencies — just clone and open `index.html` in a browser.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fjye1/Idle_hands
```

> **Note:** The contact form posts to a private Google Sheet. To use it yourself 
> you'll need to deploy your own Google Apps Script and update the endpoint URL in the JS.

## Notes
The contact form uses Google Apps Script as a lightweight serverless handler, 
so no server or paid form service is needed to receive submissions.
